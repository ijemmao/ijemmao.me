# Timetracker

After graduating from college, I wanted to create a new small side 
project to fill my newfound spare time. I didn't want to get invested 
in an overly ambitious project; I needed something manageable but 
still purposeful.

## Tracking Personal Time
I had so much free time after graduation because I was waiting to start 
my job as a Front End Software Engineer at Squarespace in New York. 
So, I mainly passed the time watching TV and videos online. But what used 
to be an excitement to finally get to relax and catch up on missed TV turned 
into a severe amount of sluggishness and guilt from laziness.

While I was on YouTube, I came across two vidoes. One by [Kurtis Baute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tnX81N6Ris&t=209s) and 
another by [Nathaniel Drew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tnX81N6Ris&t=209s).

Though these two videos had two very different motives of tracking 
personal time, they both had similar benefits of having a better 
sense of how they were spending their time.

These videos inspired me to start tracking my own time. So, instead 
of downloading another app, I decided to take this opportunity to get 
back into mobile development.

## Design
If there's one thing that I've learned as a software engineer over the 
years it that designing a rought version of the final product uncovers 
possible pitfalls during development. Which, over time, reduces tech debt, 
bugs, and general loss of time.

The first version of the application was simple: allow the user to track 
their time by creating an event that falls under a pre-defined category 
with a description attached.

## Tech
This mobile app is developed using **React Native** as the front end 
framework and **MongodDB** as the database language.

There's really nothing more to it!

## End Goal
Timetracker started as a way to pass free time but has turned into a small 
but mighty personal passion project that aims to give me the space 
to learn and grow as a software engineer. As time goes on and new ideas 
come to my mind, I'll slowly expand the functionality and capabilities of 
the app.
