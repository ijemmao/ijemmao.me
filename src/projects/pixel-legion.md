I've never worked on a web app as a standalone freelancer. 
I wanted to dip my toes in the freelancing world to see 
if I would learn development skills and processes.

## Connecting Gamers
While I was scrolling through 
[r/forhire](https://reddit.com/r/forhire), I came across a non-descriptive
[post](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/c0nuvx/hiring_midsenior_fullstack_developer_for_web/) 
that mentioned the tech that I'm comfortable with. I reached 
out and got selected to start working on the project as soon 
as possible.

The idea behind the web application is to connect novice gamers 
with professional gamers so the professionals can teach helpful 
skills and strategies to casual gamers.

## Design
My partner for this project provides high-fi mocks which he 
creates in Adobe XD and Figma. He sends me the mock ups and 
we discuss the expected functionality. If he forgets to include 
a state or screen, we'll talk about what that would look like.

## Tech
The web app uses **React** as the front end framework, **MongoDB** 
as the database language, and **Redux** for data management.

## End Goal
I signed onto this project to build out the MVP of the web 
application. After that, my partner is able to take whatever I 
built and continue his business goals.
