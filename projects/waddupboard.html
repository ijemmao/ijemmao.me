      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Waddupboard is a web application that allows users to attach notes and organize them however they want on a board. Again, the front end was built on React and the backend with Firebase. This was another assignment for my class <a href="https://cs52.me/" target="_blank">CS52</a>.</p>
      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>Since this was an assignment for class, I worked on this alone. I designed the front end and created data models that would be used in Firebase. The database kept track of the location, text/images, and color of each card.</p>
      <h2>What Went Well</h2>
      <p>I had prior knowledge using Firebase. It was really easy to get started with the API since the tool has such great documentation.</p>
      <h2>What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
      <p>I had an issue with live updating the position of each card. I struggled with coming up with a solution that would update the position of each card in realtime without have to make dozens of calls to Firebase.</p>
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>Sometimes brute force is the answer. This doesn't apply to every single tasks assigned; however, in the scope of assignment sometimes getting something to work is better than having nothing at all.</p>
      <h2>Final Product</h2>
