      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p><a href="https://collegepulse.com/" target="_blank">Pulse</a> is a survey taking platform focused on enabling college students with data. All answers for each survey are anonymous to any other survey taker. This allows the community to have data to drive conversations.</p>
      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>I worked on this project for my entire junior year in college. During that time I have worked on both the front end and backend. Specifically, I worked on the desktop front end by implementing new designs and enhancing pre-existing functionality to make for a better user experience. On the backend, I create and expand numerous MongoDB schemas and writing tests for new features.</p>
      <h2>What Went Well</h2>
      <p>Pulse was a small group of college students. This allowed me to have very close contact with the other developers and the business focused students. Communication and ownership was very high on the team. I learned to fail fast very early in my web development career which was helped me understand the quick nature of start ups. <br /><br />
        
      On top of that since the production process was fairly fast-paced, I got to see my work get used by my peers every week. This made me want work commit more challenging work. This project definitely kept me busy during the school year.</p>
      <h2>What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
      <p>Onboarding was a big issue with this project. I joined the team when there was a pre-existing code base. Because many people joined after the project got started, information about certain portions of the project were unknown. I had to refer to the same person which slowed down some tasks on my end. <br /><br />

      Even though we had a PM, we didn't have strictly defined sprints to keep the team on track. On top of that, the team barely prioritized features during each term. It was hard for me to understand what the team was pushing for the quarter. Because of this, I found myself starting and dropping a number of issues that could have been easily organized and addressed if a portion of the team sat down and defined a more rigid schedule.
      </p>
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>The startup environment can be invigorating and exciting, but also tiring. As a student, working on such a project was extremely rewarding. I got to work with business, marketing, and technical people throughout the year, and I learned how a small business functions. On top of that, I got to work on the project's entire stack which I didn't think I would do in college. However, even though this project allowed me to realize that I want to do web development, this project showed me that I value streamlined roles. This project asked me to work on every piece of the stack. Good for initial exposure, but uninspiring after a year. This project made me realize that I want to specifically focus on frontend web development in any environment.</p>
      <h2>Final Product - Future Plans</h2>
      <p>Pulse was finalist in <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Y Combinator</a> for the summer of 2018. Many of the members graduated and decided to move to the Silicon Valley to use their grant money to expand the project. I decided to leave the project in order to complete my final year in college in New Hampshire.</p>
