      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Seabird Apps is a mobile application that serves a generalized approach to creating college mobile apps. The project that I worked on was a mobile application that focused on creating an application for Dartmouth College.</p>
      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>This was my first project working on a mobile application with an established team. My official roles were project manager and mobile developer. During the 20 weeks I worked on this project, I managed the flow and organization of the team while committing technical work for the project. I spent somewhere around 15 hours every week working on this project. <br /><br />
      
      When it came to development, I specifically worked on the front end using React Native. With that being said, though, the backend was purely managed with Firebase since most of the pre-existing data were located in large spreadsheets. There were numerous components that were introduced in this project that came from <code>npm</code> which made more technical development a whole lot easier. <br /><br />

      As a project manager, I created and assigned tasks to the other developers and designers on the team. I also reviewed Pull Requests and went through informal design reviews to complete understand what is expected from developers. 
    
    </p>
      <h2>What Went Well</h2>
      <p>Throughout the 20 weeks, the team, for the most part, stayed the same. This was great because we didn't have to do much onboarding during the second half of the development process. On top of that, we already knew how to work and interact with each other. <br /><br />
      
      Communication was especially helpful when it came to defining issues to assign to members. Everyone on the team quickly picked up on the pattern of issues that were created. Because of that, they were fairly involved in the issue creation process. They also knew what was expected in stand ups and formed their reports in such a manner that they would be successful in relaying all important information.</p>
      <h2>What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
      <p>One thing that didn't necessarily help the team move forward was the partner's lack of direction. I felt as though I was making decision for the partner when the partner should be heavily influencing the decisions of the team. This made me feel as though I was the owner of the project where in reality I should be realizing the goals the partners initially had. <br /><br />
      
      Another thing that could have been better was initial onboarding for new members on the team. Even though the entire team was able to grow throughout the 20 weeks, the first couple of weeks were especially difficult because people were completely new to designing and developing.</p>
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>I learned that teams need to have strong directional leaders in order succeed. Without people who are passionate about their ideas or visions, it's very easy to become misguided and sway from the original intent.</p>
      <h2>Final Product - Future Plans</h2>
      <p>Here's a paragraph with information about the background of the project. Usually this isn't too long. However, this
        paragraph should manage to perfect define the purpose and scope of the project and team. Try to provide a vivid image
        of the work flow in this project. Try to include names and tasks that were introduced throughout the development
        process but don't use tooooo much detail.</p>
