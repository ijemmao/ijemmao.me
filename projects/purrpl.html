      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Purrpl is a self-care mobile application. There's a purple cat that serves as the meter for people's overall wellness. When users don't complete tasks that are created to help their wellness, the cat becomes tired and/or sad. If the user keeps up with their tasks, then the cat is happy and refreshed. The app was built with React Native and the backend was constructed using MongoDB + Mongoose. There was a team that consisted of six people. This was the final project for my class <a href="https://cs52.me/" target="_blank">CS52</a>.</p>
      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>We worked on this project for about a month. In that time, I played the rolls of project manager, front end and backend engineer. I helped create tasks that were later assigned to different members to keep the entire team on track. I also helped create the API that interacts with the front end. I made sure that the different screens on the front end were matching up with the mockups in Figma.</p>
      <h2>What Went Well</h2>
      <p>Since we had to create an app idea for our final project, we brainstormed a multitude of ideas. Luckily, every member of the team was open to all the ideas and built on top of the majority of them. Communication and collaboration was surprisingly high for a school team project. When people didn't understand how to complete on of their tasks, they felt comfortable asking other teammates for help.</p>
      <h2>What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
      <p>One major setback that affected the team was the lack of support and documentation for Windows user. One of our teammates had a Windows laptop and had numerous issues running <code>npm/yarn</code> and working with a simulator. Knowing how to work with Windows machines for this project beforehand would have been extremely helpful for the entirety of the project.</p>
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>It's extremely important to plan and execute a reasonable scope. There were a ton of wild ideas that were passed around before we landed with the scope we used for the month. Throughout the development process, we found ourselves slowly shaving off features from the application. This process, in the long run, wasted time that could have been spent on executing a plan that was organized properly on day 1.</p>
      <h2>Final Product</h2>
      <p>The mobile app was never released on the app store. However, there are two private repositories on GitHub, one for the front end another for the backend. If you would like to see or talk about the code, feel free to send me an email!</p>
