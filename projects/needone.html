      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>NeedOne is a mobile application that attempts to make connections on the Dartmouth campus through the game of Pong. The front end was built with React Native and the backend was supported with Firebase. This project was created through WISP, Women in Science Project, on campus. There were three first year women who were made up the team that created this application. They were given two terms to create an app as a form of experiential learning specifically in computer science.</p>
      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>I mentored this team for the two terms. Since these three women were first years, they had little to knowledge about the mobile application developmental process. Because of this, I made sure that I created and assigned tasks, taught them new tools and technologies like git/GitHub, React Native, Firebase, etc., and provided them resources on campus to help them with technical development and presentation skills. <br /><br />I set up bi-weekly meetings, two meetings a week, that were split up into two main sections: stand up/announcements and group work. I wanted to them to have the experience of presenting the work they did throughout the week and working with others who are learning the same technology. On top of that, I wanted to make myself available at standard times, so I set up these meetings so they can ask me questions. I also encouraged to reach out to my anytime so we could work on any technical issues that arose.</p>
      <h2>What Went Well</h2>
      <p>The three women that I worked with were all eager to learn about the technologies that were presented to them. Even though Dartmouth terms can be particularly tiring and trying, they all still made efforts to make it to meetings on time, and if they were late they would make sure to set up a time where they could work with me to ensure that they were still on track.</p>
      <h2>What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
      <p>There were times where they wouldn't ask questions at crucial points in the developmental process. Because of this, I would assume knowledge that they didn't have at that moment. Over time, they felt more comfortable asking me questions, but in the beginning it was especially difficult to gage their skills because, even during meetings, they would feel uncomfortable sharing what they knew or didn't know.</p>
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>Patience and the ability to teach new material is extremely important! I realized, after this experience, that for the longest time I underestimated the skill of teaching and explaining. Because I only had experience learning with other people my age who were learning at the same time as me, I never had the experience of teaching material that I felt that I had a sense of mastery over. I was always on the receiving end of teaching. This project taught me to work with people who might have no experience working with certain libraries and frameworks. </p>
      <h2>Final Product</h2>
      <p>The app isn't on the app store, but you can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/jennyengelman/PongMates" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can run the app on <a href="https://expo.io/" target="_blank">Expo</a>, which is a toolchain that makes building React Native apps on iOS and Android devices easy.</p>
