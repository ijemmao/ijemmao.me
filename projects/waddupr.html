      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Waddupr is a web application that allows users to create multi-media posts in a feed-like format, very similar to Tumblr. The front end was built with React and the backend was developed with MongoDB + Mongoose. This app was created for my Full Stack Web Development class, <a href="http://cs52.me/" target="_blank">CS52</a>.</p>
      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>Since this was an assignment for class, I worked on this project by myself. I constructed data models, created a API to interact with the database, and designed the front end.</p>
      <h2>What Went Well</h2>
      <p>Since I was working on this project by myself, I had the freedom to make decisions without having to consult other teammates. Because of this, the overall developmental process was a lot faster, which left me with extra time to incorporate extra features. </p>
      <h2>What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
      <p>I would have liked more guidance on how to approach creating your own API. There were numerous moments when I wasn't completely sure how I should standardize the structure of data chunks that were coming from the backend. Was I making API functions too granular, too general, etc. There was a lot of confusion in the beginning that I had to address before I completed my assignment.</p>
      <h2>Final Product</h2>
      <p><a href="http://waddupr.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Here's</a> the final product of my app. Feel free to add any notes!</p>
