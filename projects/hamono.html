      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Hamono is a desktop and mobile application programmed in C# that focuses on directional clicking and slashing to interact with the game's environment.</p>
      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>I was one of the two developers on the team. This was my first project working with C# and Unity. Despite the learning curve that I had to face, I created and assigned tasks to not only myself but also the developer so we knew the developmental progress of the project. The team only had six weeks to complete this project, so everything was fairly fast paced. I worked on the hit and hurt boxes of the main characters and other enemies, persisted data throughout the entire game, and implemented UI components and the game's <a href="#">website!</a></p>
      <h2>What Went Well</h2>
      <p>I was working with a team that I know very well. We're all classmates and either Japanese majors or minors. Because I had connections with my teammates before we started working on this project, I felt very comfortable expressing new and different ideas. On top of that, I knew that everyone wanted to have fun and test their skills. It was a learning experience for everyone; no one set strict deadlines that would incur stress.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since we were on a six week schedule, we had two video calls over Google Hangouts every week. This allowed us to sync up on our work done in the past few days. Besides those video calls acting as our standups they were also brainstorming sessions where people could talk about creative ideas for the game. We talked about musical composition for different levels, character and level design, and even the story that painted the tone for the entire game. These calls made the experience more collaborative and fun.
      </p>
      <h2>What Could Have Gone Better</h2>
      <p>It was the teams first time ever creating a game. Because of our lack of experience, we underestimated the time it would take us to create a functioning game. Creating and assigning tasks were especially difficult because we didn't know how long it would take developers and designers to complete their tasks. We were learning as we went which was manageable but not smart when setting deadlines for the project. I think if the team recognized that due to the fact that we didn't have prior experience of making a game we should have approached our tasks with slightly quicker deadlines. This way we would have learned earlier on how long it actually takes to finalize a design or implement a new attack.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another issue with this project was that everyone was working remotely. The team was spread out working in New Hampshire, Texas, California, and New York. Even though video calls make the distance less of an issue, it was still hard to have clear and smooth conversations. Also, expressing our ideas were hard because we mainly resorted to using our voices. Where if were talking to each other face to face, we would have different mediums to express our ideas. 
      </p>
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>I finally understood the complexities of creating small scale games. There are so many moving pieces that many players don't realize. I have a strong background in web development, and many of the concepts seen in game development are never mentioned in web development. I reinforced my existing knowledge of allocating and managing memory, physics, and game development terminology. I also learned that enhancements of certain player functionality is virtually inevitable. Once one feature is added to the game, other features should be checked to see if they require any enhancements.</p>
      <h2>Final Product - Future Plans</h2>
      <p>Here's the website to the <a href="#">game!</a> Right now we don't have any future plans for the game, but if you would like talk about it some more you can contact me!</p>
