                <h1>Ijemma Onwuzulike</h1>
              <p class="personal-text-section">Hey! I'm Ijemma Onwuzulike, a rising senior at Dartmouth College studying Computer Science and Japanese Culture and Literature. I believe that interacting with technology should be intuitive and straightforward for everyday users. I strive to create web applications that are beautiful and appealing to the eye, while presenting useful functionality that make for a better experience.</p>
              <p class="personal-text-section">For the past two summers I have interned at eBay as a Full Stack Web Developer. During my time at the company, I've had the opportunity to expand my knowledge of web developer further than I expected.</p>
              <p class="personal-text-section">When I'm back on campus, I work in an experiental learning lab named DALI. This lab allows Dartmouth students to work on projects either as a Designer, Developer, or Project Manager to gain hands-on experience that isn't usually taught in acadamia.</p>
              <p class="personal-text-section">When I'm not developing I'm usually listening + creating music, reading up on latest tech news, or talking about numerous topics with friends.</p>
              <p class="personal-text-section">And that's me! If you want to find any more information about the work that I've done, feel free to check out my <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ijemma-onwuzulike-485152119/">LinkedIn</a> or send me an <a class="link" href="mailto:ijemma.s.onwuzulike.19@dartmouth.edu">email!</a></p>
